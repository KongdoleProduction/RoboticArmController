If you have any question, please post a new issue so everyone could see it! :blush:


## Materials List

items | quantities | remarks
---|---|---
Arduino Uno | 1 |
Perf Board | 1 | 20 x 15 (pins) 
Pin Header | 2(rows) | 40pins in a row
Potentiometer | 6 | 10kOhms
Jumper Wire(M-M)\* | 9 | 
Servo Extension Cable\*\* | 6 | 
BEC | 1 | 5V~6V, 5A
Lipo Battery | 1 | any size OK

\* used for potentiometer cable

\*\* can be replaced with male to female jumpers.

## How To Use

Schematics are located in /schematics/ directory.
- `shield.png` is image file
- `shield.sch` is eagle cad file.

Arduino source code is located in /arduino_code/ directory
- Download it, open with Arduino IDE and upload to your Arduino board.
- It is designed to run on Uno, but will work just fine on almost other Arduino boards.
